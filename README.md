# facebook-react-tutorial
An interactive tic-tac-toe game built using React.js

An effort to get familiar with:
- functional programming
- front-end (js) (webpack, static builds, npm, yarn)
- React.js: thanks to all hypes and it's popularity
- Transition React.js to React Native

Afterwards:
- more functional programming
- react-redux
- react-router
- integrate semantic-ui or similar
