An interactive tic-tac-toe game built using React.js

## An Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe Game
- lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- indicates when one player has won the game,
- stores the history of moves during the game,
- allows players to jump back in time to see older versions of the game board.

### An effort to get familiar with:
- functional programming
- front-end (js) (webpack, static builds, npm, yarn)
- React.js: thanks to all hypes and it's popularity
- Transition React.js to React Native

### Afterwards:
- more functional programming
- react-redux
- react-router
- integrate semantic-ui or similar
